            <p>
                From the moment I saw you, my heart knew,<br>
                A spark was lit, deep and true.<br>
                Not just beauty, but a soul so bright,<br>
                Like the moon that softens the darkest night.<br><br>

                You were my idol, my guiding star,<br>
                The reason I've come this far.<br>
                I stepped forward, I found my way,<br>
                All because you inspired me each day.<br><br>

                Your presence turns moments to gold,<br>
                A warmth that never fades or grows cold.<br>
                With every glance, my world stands still,<br>
                A silent whisper, a wish, a thrill.<br><br>

                I worked each day to reach your sight,<br>
                Hoping someday, I'd shine as bright.<br>
                And when I stood, with victory in hand,<br>
                It was your strength that helped me stand.<br><br>

                But love is not a chain, nor a plea,<br>
                It's the purest form of being free.<br>
                So no matter where life takes you to,<br>
                I will always cherish and wait for you. üíñ<br><br>

                        When we traveled to Karad, my only wish was to win the Paper Presentation Competition‚Äînot for myself, but to impress you. And we did it. That victory wasn‚Äôt just a trophy; it was a silent hope that maybe, just maybe, you‚Äôd see me the way I saw you.
                        
                        Then came another beautiful moment‚Äîwhen you won first prize in my event, Bollywood Day. Seeing you shine, celebrating your win, felt more special than any achievement of my own.
                        
                        And then, there was Poly Prince‚Ä¶ I was going to sing, but not for the crowd‚Äîfor you. But you weren‚Äôt there. My heart sank, but just as I was about to start, you arrived. It wasn‚Äôt planned, but it felt like destiny, like the universe aligning just to make that moment perfect.
                        
                        But the most emotional moment was when you were nominated for Best Outgoing Student. As you stood there, waiting for the result, I prayed with all my heart‚Äînot for my own future wins, but for you. I wanted nothing more than to see you hold that trophy, to see the happiness in your eyes. Because in that moment, your victory felt like my own, and your happiness meant everything to me. ‚ù§Ô∏è.</p>

                    <p class="timeline-text">After all these moments, all these silent wishes, today is the day I finally gather the courage to tell you what my heart has been holding onto for so long.

                        I know this is your final year, the most important one, and I don‚Äôt want to distract you from your dreams, your goals‚Äîbecause they matter. Your success, your future, they mean everything, and I will always stand by you, cheering for you in every step you take.
                        
                        But if I don‚Äôt say this now, I know I‚Äôll regret it forever. Keeping it inside, hoping for the perfect moment, waiting for destiny to align again‚ÄîI can‚Äôt do that anymore. Because the truth is, every moment with you has already been perfect in its own way.
                        
                        So here I am, not with expectations, not with demands, but with nothing but love in my heart. Love that has grown from a silent wish into something undeniable. No matter what your answer is, no matter what the future holds, I just want you to know‚Äîyou have been, and always will be, the most beautiful part of my story. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

                        <p>
                            Dear Piyusha,<br><br>
                            I don‚Äôt know how to put this into words, but I can‚Äôt keep this inside any longer. From the very first time I saw you, something about you stood out‚Äîsomething I couldn‚Äôt ignore, no matter how much I tried. It wasn‚Äôt just your smile, your kindness, or the way you carry yourself with such quiet confidence. It was the way you made the world around you seem a little more beautiful, a little more alive.<br><br>
                            For a longest time,I kept my feelings hidden watching you from afar , admiring everything that makes you so special. But then, life gave me a moment with you‚Äîthe day we traveled together to Karad for the competition and also returned back to Kolhapur together. That day was special in ways I can‚Äôt explain. Sitting beside you, talking to you, simply existing in the same space as you‚Äîit felt like the universe had given me a glimpse of something wonderful. A memory I‚Äôll hold onto forever.<br><br>
                            
                            And now, as your last semester unfolds, I find myself caught between the joy of having known you and the sadness of knowing that soon, you‚Äôll be walking a path where I might not get to see you as often‚Äîor maybe, not at all. The thought of not being able to see you, to hear your voice, or to feel your presence around me, disturbs me every day. I don‚Äôt know what the future holds, but I do know this: I couldn‚Äôt let you go without telling you how much you mean to me.<br><br>
                            
                            I don‚Äôt expect anything, nor do I wish to burden you with these feelings. Your dreams, your goals‚Äîthose come first, and I would never want to be a distraction from the incredible things you‚Äôre meant to achieve. I just wanted you to know that, in this world full of fleeting moments and passing faces, you were someone who truly left a mark on my heart.<br><br>
                            
                            But more than that, I want you to know this‚ÄîI will always care for you. No matter where life takes us, no matter how far apart we may be, a part of me will always belong to you. And if life ever gives me even the smallest chance to be by your side, I‚Äôll be there. I will wait for you, for as long as it takes. Until my last breath, I will hold you in my heart.<br> <br> 
                            
                            And there‚Äôs something else I‚Äôve never told you ‚Äì you are the reason I started participating in paper presentation comptitions. Seeing your confidence ,your dedication , and the way you strive for excellence inspired me to step out of my comfort zone. If I have grown, if I have achieved anything a part of it is because of you. You unknowingly gave me the courage to push myself , and for that ,I will always be grateful.<br><br>
                            
                            I also want to say this, I am not like other boys who play with the emotions of girls. I respect girls and their feelings, and I could never think of hurting you in any way. If I just wanted to propose to you , I could have done it at last years or these years Spandan , but I don‚Äôt believe in that , I don‚Äôt believe I grand gestures just for the sake of it . I believe in true emotions, in honesty, in letting my heart speak in the most genuine way possible. That‚Äôs why I chose this letter ‚Äì because this is the only way I could truly express what I feel.<br><br>
                            
                            If this letter hurts you in any way , I am truly sorry !!. That was never my intention. But if I had kept these feelings buried inside , I knew I would regret it for the rest of my life. I would rather be honest about my heart than live with the weight of unspoken words.<br><br>
                            
                            I don‚Äôt expect an answer right away. You can take your time to know me better, to understand what I truly feel. I‚Äôve been admiring you since my first year, but I want you to see me for who I am, beyond just these words. And if someday you feel like replying , I‚Äôll be right here, waiting not with expectations, but with hope.<br><br>
                            
                            No matter where life takes you, I hope you find happiness, love, and all the success you deserve. And if ever you look back and remember me, I hope it‚Äôs with the warmth of knowing that someone, somewhere, will always be wishing the best for you.<br><br>
                            
                            With all my heart,

                From the very first day I saw you, my heart chose you. Every moment, every silent wish, and every little effort was for you. I don‚Äôt know if destiny truly exists, but if it does, it has been bringing me closer to you in the most beautiful ways‚Äîthrough shared moments, victories, and the little coincidences that never felt like accidents.

I‚Äôve admired you not just for your beauty, but for your kindness, your strength, and the way you light up every place you walk into. And then‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs your voice. The voice that feels like a melody, the one that brings me peace, that I could listen to forever.

Today, I stand here, not with promises of a perfect love story, but with the promise of always being there‚Äîthrough your happiest moments and your hardest days, as your biggest supporter, your best friend, and someone who will always choose you.

So, with all my heart, I ask you‚ÄîWill you be mine? Will you let me be a part of your story, just like you‚Äôve been the most beautiful part of mine? ‚ù§Ô∏è
