            <p>
                From the moment I saw you, my heart knew,<br>
                A spark was lit, deep and true.<br>
                Not just beauty, but a soul so bright,<br>
                Like the moon that softens the darkest night.<br><br>

                You were my idol, my guiding star,<br>
                The reason I've come this far.<br>
                I stepped forward, I found my way,<br>
                All because you inspired me each day.<br><br>

                Your presence turns moments to gold,<br>
                A warmth that never fades or grows cold.<br>
                With every glance, my world stands still,<br>
                A silent whisper, a wish, a thrill.<br><br>

                I worked each day to reach your sight,<br>
                Hoping someday, I'd shine as bright.<br>
                And when I stood, with victory in hand,<br>
                It was your strength that helped me stand.<br><br>

                But love is not a chain, nor a plea,<br>
                It's the purest form of being free.<br>
                So no matter where life takes you to,<br>
                I will always cherish and wait for you. 💖<br><br>

That day, without you even realizing it, you became the most beautiful part of my story. From that moment on, every glance, every smile, and every silent moment felt like a chapter waiting to be written… with you.</p>

                        Then, as if the universe had finally heard my silent wishes, the second year brought unexpected chances—traveling together to Karad, working side by side for Technova. It wasn’t just coincidence; it felt like destiny, like God Himself was creating moments to bring us closer. And in those moments, I finally found the chance I had been waiting for… to be a part of your world. ❤️

</h3>
                    <p class="timeline-text">Some moments in life feel like fate’s gentle whispers, guiding us toward something special.

                        When we traveled to Karad, my only wish was to win the Paper Presentation Competition—not for myself, but to impress you. And we did it. That victory wasn’t just a trophy; it was a silent hope that maybe, just maybe, you’d see me the way I saw you.
                        
                        Then came another beautiful moment—when you won first prize in my event, Bollywood Day. Seeing you shine, celebrating your win, felt more special than any achievement of my own.
                        
                        And then, there was Poly Prince… I was going to sing, but not for the crowd—for you. But you weren’t there. My heart sank, but just as I was about to start, you arrived. It wasn’t planned, but it felt like destiny, like the universe aligning just to make that moment perfect.
                        
                        But the most emotional moment was when you were nominated for Best Outgoing Student. As you stood there, waiting for the result, I prayed with all my heart—not for my own future wins, but for you. I wanted nothing more than to see you hold that trophy, to see the happiness in your eyes. Because in that moment, your victory felt like my own, and your happiness meant everything to me. ❤️.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p class="timeline-text">After all these moments, all these silent wishes, today is the day I finally gather the courage to tell you what my heart has been holding onto for so long.

                        I know this is your final year, the most important one, and I don’t want to distract you from your dreams, your goals—because they matter. Your success, your future, they mean everything, and I will always stand by you, cheering for you in every step you take.
                        
                        But if I don’t say this now, I know I’ll regret it forever. Keeping it inside, hoping for the perfect moment, waiting for destiny to align again—I can’t do that anymore. Because the truth is, every moment with you has already been perfect in its own way.
                        
                        So here I am, not with expectations, not with demands, but with nothing but love in my heart. Love that has grown from a silent wish into something undeniable. No matter what your answer is, no matter what the future holds, I just want you to know—you have been, and always will be, the most beautiful part of my story. ❤️</p>

                        <h2>To My Dearest Piyusha 💖</h2>
                        <p>
                            Dear Piyusha,<br><br>
                            I don’t know how to put this into words, but I can’t keep this inside any longer. From the very first time I saw you, something about you stood out—something I couldn’t ignore, no matter how much I tried. It wasn’t just your smile, your kindness, or the way you carry yourself with such quiet confidence. It was the way you made the world around you seem a little more beautiful, a little more alive.<br><br>
                            For a longest time,I kept my feelings hidden watching you from afar , admiring everything that makes you so special. But then, life gave me a moment with you—the day we traveled together to Karad for the competition and also returned back to Kolhapur together. That day was special in ways I can’t explain. Sitting beside you, talking to you, simply existing in the same space as you—it felt like the universe had given me a glimpse of something wonderful. A memory I’ll hold onto forever.<br><br>
                            
                            And now, as your last semester unfolds, I find myself caught between the joy of having known you and the sadness of knowing that soon, you’ll be walking a path where I might not get to see you as often—or maybe, not at all. The thought of not being able to see you, to hear your voice, or to feel your presence around me, disturbs me every day. I don’t know what the future holds, but I do know this: I couldn’t let you go without telling you how much you mean to me.<br><br>
                            
                            I don’t expect anything, nor do I wish to burden you with these feelings. Your dreams, your goals—those come first, and I would never want to be a distraction from the incredible things you’re meant to achieve. I just wanted you to know that, in this world full of fleeting moments and passing faces, you were someone who truly left a mark on my heart.<br><br>
                            
                            But more than that, I want you to know this—I will always care for you. No matter where life takes us, no matter how far apart we may be, a part of me will always belong to you. And if life ever gives me even the smallest chance to be by your side, I’ll be there. I will wait for you, for as long as it takes. Until my last breath, I will hold you in my heart.<br> <br> 
                            
                            And there’s something else I’ve never told you – you are the reason I started participating in paper presentation comptitions. Seeing your confidence ,your dedication , and the way you strive for excellence inspired me to step out of my comfort zone. If I have grown, if I have achieved anything a part of it is because of you. You unknowingly gave me the courage to push myself , and for that ,I will always be grateful.<br><br>
                            
                            I also want to say this, I am not like other boys who play with the emotions of girls. I respect girls and their feelings, and I could never think of hurting you in any way. If I just wanted to propose to you , I could have done it at last years or these years Spandan , but I don’t believe in that , I don’t believe I grand gestures just for the sake of it . I believe in true emotions, in honesty, in letting my heart speak in the most genuine way possible. That’s why I chose this letter – because this is the only way I could truly express what I feel.<br><br>
                            
                            If this letter hurts you in any way , I am truly sorry !!. That was never my intention. But if I had kept these feelings buried inside , I knew I would regret it for the rest of my life. I would rather be honest about my heart than live with the weight of unspoken words.<br><br>
                            
                            I don’t expect an answer right away. You can take your time to know me better, to understand what I truly feel. I’ve been admiring you since my first year, but I want you to see me for who I am, beyond just these words. And if someday you feel like replying , I’ll be right here, waiting not with expectations, but with hope.<br><br>
                            
                            No matter where life takes you, I hope you find happiness, love, and all the success you deserve. And if ever you look back and remember me, I hope it’s with the warmth of knowing that someone, somewhere, will always be wishing the best for you.<br><br>
                            
                            With all my heart,  
                            <br>

                From the very first day I saw you, my heart chose you. Every moment, every silent wish, and every little effort was for you. I don’t know if destiny truly exists, but if it does, it has been bringing me closer to you in the most beautiful ways—through shared moments, victories, and the little coincidences that never felt like accidents.

I’ve admired you not just for your beauty, but for your kindness, your strength, and the way you light up every place you walk into. And then… there’s your voice. The voice that feels like a melody, the one that brings me peace, that I could listen to forever.

Today, I stand here, not with promises of a perfect love story, but with the promise of always being there—through your happiest moments and your hardest days, as your biggest supporter, your best friend, and someone who will always choose you.

So, with all my heart, I ask you—Will you be mine? Will you let me be a part of your story, just like you’ve been the most beautiful part of mine? ❤️
